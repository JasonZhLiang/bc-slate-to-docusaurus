#### Hit a roadblock?Â Help is right around the corner!

There are three places to look for brainCloud information:

- [API Docs](/learn/introduction) (this site) - conceptual overviews, tutorials, etc.
- [API Reference](/api/introduction) - detailed method and response signatures across C++, C#, Java, Javascript, etc
- [Knowledge base](http://help.getbraincloud.com) - frequently asked questions

If you can't find what you are looking for,Â please don't hesitate to contact us using the green help widget in the bottom right-hand corner of the portal and APIÂ pages. We'll get back to you as soon as we can!
