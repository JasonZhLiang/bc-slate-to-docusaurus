Attributes are tags (key+value pairs) that can be assigned to a user either manually or programmatically. They are primarily (but not exclusively) Â used in defining and filtering segments for Promotions.

To add a new Attribute simply click the plus icon in the top right next to the record count. Â The keys and values of any of the attributes can be edited directly in the list. Â To delete an Attribute click the trash icon to the right of it. Â None of these actions are applied until the **Save** button is pressed. Â That means by pressing **Cancel** you can revert any changes you made from the last time you saved.
