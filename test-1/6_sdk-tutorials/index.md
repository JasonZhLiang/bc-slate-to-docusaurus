Welcome to the BRAINCLOUD SDK tutorials.

BRAINCLOUD is a big system, with a veryÂ comprehensive set of features, APIs and tools. Â These tutorials aim to de-mystify the system and get you up-and-running as quickly as possible.

And yeah, we are aware that these tutorials (and the docs themselves) don't yet have the full coverage that they should. Â We realize and are working hard to address that. If you're confused or can't find some information, please reach out via the chat button in the portalÂ - we'll answer any questions immediately, andÂ work to quickly address the documentation issueÂ as well!

We're committed to aggressively adding and improving our tutorialÂ library (and our documentation in general) as we grow theÂ systemÂ - thanks for bearing with us!
