## Mobile Multiplayer

BRAINCLOUD provides _built-in_ support for mobile-friendly, non-realtime multiplayer.

Full APIs for the following multiplayer types are provided:

- **Turn-by-Turn Async** - made popular by games like Words with Friends, Draw Something, etc.
- **One-way Offline** - made popular by games like Clash of Clans, Boom Beach, etc.

BRAINCLOUD also provides customizable _offline matchmaking_ support (perfect for the above multiplayer options).

## Online Multiplayer via RTT

BRAINCLOUD RTT adds support for _Online Matchmaking_ and _Lobbies,_Â and the development of custom _Room Experiences_ to meet the needs for today's most competitive online experiences.
