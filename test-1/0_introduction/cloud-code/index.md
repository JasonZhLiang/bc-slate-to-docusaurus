_If BRAINCLOUD doesn't support a feature you need? Write it!_

BRAINCLOUD allowsÂ developers to write custom code in JavaScript, and call it from aÂ client, another server, or trigger it automatically as a pre-condition or post-condition of a standard BRAINCLOUD API call.

More informationÂ on Cloud Code is available [here](/api/cc).
