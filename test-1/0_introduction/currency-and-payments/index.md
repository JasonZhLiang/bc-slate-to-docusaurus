BRAINCLOUD provides rich support for Free-to-Play Monetization, including:

- **Virtual Currencies** - games (apps) can be configured with an unlimited number of virtual currencies
- **Products** - BRAINCLOUD can be used to define the virtual currency bundles that are purchasable via IAP
- **Pricing** - BRAINCLOUD supports multiple price-points per product, with linkages to the pricing entries in the various platform app stores. This allows for pricing across all platforms to be centrally controlled and changed with a "click".
- **Promotions** - BRAINCLOUD also provides a robust Promotions API, which can allow product management to dynamically apply promotion pricing according to established schedules or via advanced targeting of player segments
