## The Three P's - Products, Pricing, and Promotions

BRAINCLOUD is not an e-commerce platform itself - but it integrates with the various platform stores (iOS AppStore, Google Play, Facebook Store, Steam Store, Windows Store, etc.) to facilitate and secure the purchasing process - while providing advanced support for pricing and promotions.

## Products

BRAINCLOUD's monetization support centers around the purchase of products. Â Products are theÂ IAPÂ purchases that a user may make in your app. Â For example, in Clash of Clans, the products would be the bundles of coins, elixir, and gems that the user purchases for real money in the storeÂ -- not the CannonsÂ andÂ Archer Towers that can be purchased with those products.

Products are often associated with Virtual Currencies, which BRAINCLOUD also provides support for -- but they don't have to be.

## Pricing

Products in BRAINCLOUD can have multiple priceÂ points (called Price Entries) - just like in a physical retail store.Â  The regular or default price is called the **List Price**, while the other prices are defined and available for use in **Promotional Sales**.

Price Entries areÂ used to tie BRAINCLOUD Products to the product/pricing info of the Platform Stores (like the iOS App Store).

Each AppStore works differently - in iOS, all price points must be defined ahead of time in iTunes Connect. Â Google Play and Windows Store work this way too. Â In Facebook and Steam, however, the product prices are controlled directly by BRAINCLOUD and provided to the store upon request. Â Although the exact details vary by store - BRAINCLOUD allows you toÂ manage the pricing of your products centrally across all platforms.

## Promotions

Building upon Products and Pricing are the Promotions features - whichÂ allow you to present your users with "special offers" of preferred pricing of products, or even exclusive products that aren't normally available.

BRAINCLOUD provides two forms of promotions:

- Scheduled Promotions - promotions that are to be offered during specific calendar dates - such as a "Christmas Holiday Sale"
- Automated Promotions - promotions that are offered to a specific target segment of users, and triggered as each individual user enters that segment (i.e. "New User" promotion for users who activated the game less than 5 days ago)
