<%= partial(:"partials/versionTag", :locals => {
  :version => "3.8.0",
  :newText => "",
  :comingText => ""
}) %>

<%= data.branding.productName %> is built upon a high performance request/response architecture.
This means that its APIs are REST-like -- essentially you only received data from
<%= data.branding.productName %> servers by directly requesting it (i.e. request/reponse).


<%= data.branding.productName %>'s new Real-Time Tech (RTT) featureset expands upon these capabilities -
adding the ability for <%= data.branding.productName %> to push information and updates to clients
that need it.

![RTT](<%= I18n.t(:root) %> <%= data.images.rtt_architecture %>)

Services that require RTT include:

* Chat
* Lobbies
* Online Matchmaking
* Presence

In addition, the following services have been enhanced to take advantage of RTT (if enabled):

* Async Multiplayer
* Events
* Messaging
