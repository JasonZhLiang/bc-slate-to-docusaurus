This method is available in Cloud Code scripts only.

Delete the specified chat message. Message can be from any user (or the system). Version must match (or pass -1 to bypass version enforcement).

Returns the number of messages that were deleted. Since the history rolls over, it is possible that the message had already expired before the deletion attempt - in that case, the value of the `deleted` field will be `0`.
