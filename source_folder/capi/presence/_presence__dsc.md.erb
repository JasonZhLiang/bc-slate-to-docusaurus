Online Presence allows an app's users to know which of their friends are currently online, what they are doing, and whether they are available to interact.

The Presence Service enables the tracking of this live user activity. In order for any of these calls to be functional, the Presence feature must be enabled for your app. *<%= data.branding.productName %> RTT is also required.*

See **Design | Messaging | Presence** in the portal.
