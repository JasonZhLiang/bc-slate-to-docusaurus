The Global Statistics service allows you to retrieve and update your app's predefined statistics defined on the
[Global Statistics](https://portal.braincloudservers.com/admin/dashboard#/development/stats-game) page of the <%= data.branding.productName %> portal.

Global Statistics must be pre-defined from the [Statistics Rules - Global Statistics page](https://portal.braincloudservers.com/admin/dashboard#/development/stats-game)
of the <%= data.branding.productName %> portal.  If instead you need to create them dynamically at runtime, you can enable the Generate App Statistic Rule Enabled setting on the
[Advanced Settings page](https://portal.braincloudservers.com/admin/dashboard#/development/core-settings-advanced-settings) of your app in the <%= data.branding.productName %> portal.

Global (or App) Statistics are similar to User Stats, except that they are stored centrally across all of an app's users.
