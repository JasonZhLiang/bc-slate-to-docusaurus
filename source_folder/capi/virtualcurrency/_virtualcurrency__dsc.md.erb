The **VirtualCurrency Service** manages virtual currency balances for app users. 

*This service replaces the currency functions of the deprecated **Product Service**.* The currency APIs of the two services are largely the same, with the following two changes:

* For security purposes, only the get methods are callable from the client -- use *Cloud Code* for the rest
* We have cleaned up the responses a bit, removing unnecessary fields like `createdAt`, `updatedAt` and `profileId`
