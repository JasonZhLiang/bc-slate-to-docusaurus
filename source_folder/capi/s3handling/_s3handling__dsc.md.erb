The methods in the S3 Handling service (also known as the legacy Global File service) are used to access the files uploaded to the [Custom Config | Files](https://portal.braincloudservers.com/admin/dashboard#/development/files) section of the portal.

Using these methods you can, among other things, determine if files have been updated and retrieve the URL to download them.

<aside class="warning">
This service has been deprecated. It is recommended that apps move to the new GlobalFiles (i.e. GlobalFilesV3) service.
