The **Item Catalog** service is a key component of the **Item Management** system.
All items to be managed (i.e. awarded, purchased, sold, traded, etc.) must be first defined in the *Item Catalog*.

Items in the catalog can be in one of four states:

* DRAFT - item is currently still be defined. Cannot be purchased or awarded
* PUBLISHED - item is now available for award, purchase and trading.
* RETIRED - item is no longer available for purchase or awarding, but a user can still keep it in their inventory. And the item can still be traded or sold.
* REVOKED - the item has being removed from circulation. Will be deleted from user's inventory upon refresh.

Items are normally defined and published via the **Design | Item Management | Item Catalog** screen of the Design Portal.

This service is primarily used to retrieve lists of items from the catalog for display in store purchase screens. Items are then awarded/purchased/traded via the **User Items** service.
