User state contains methods for accessing user-specific information like name and contact email.

It also provides access to the User Attributes APIs allowing you to assign key+value pairs to a user.
These are primarily used in defining and filtering segments for Promotions.

New in 4.2, we've added our *Timed Status Effects* API. These API calls allow developers to associated a "status" with a user for a specified amount of time. The status will automatically be removed when it expires.

Active status effects are returned automatically during Authentication and via ReadUserState. They can also be retrieved directly via GetUserStatus.
