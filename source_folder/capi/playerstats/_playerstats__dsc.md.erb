The BrainCloudPlayerStatistics service is used for all user-scoped statistics operations, including Player Experience (XP).

User Stats must be pre-defined from the [Statistics Rules - User Statistics page](https://portal.braincloudservers.com/admin/dashboard#/development/stats-player)
of the <%= data.branding.productName %> portal.  If instead you need to create them dynamically at runtime, you can enable the Generate User Statistic Rule Enabled setting on the
[Advanced Settings page](https://portal.braincloudservers.com/admin/dashboard#/development/core-settings-advanced-settings) of your app in the <%= data.branding.productName %> portal.
