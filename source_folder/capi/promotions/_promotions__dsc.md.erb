**Promotions** is a new service that allows devs to create/edit/delete promotions programmatically via S2S and cloud-code.

*Important notes (when creating or updating a promotion):*

* Include only products that you want to CHANGE the price of in the "prices" section of the JSON
* Products whose prices are to remain UNCHANGED should not be included in "prices"
* Products to remove from availability should be encoded with a priceId of -2
