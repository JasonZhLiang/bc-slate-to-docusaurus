**Custom Entities** are very similar to **Global Entities**, but with several advanced features that make them more applicable for larger data sets.

Like *Global Entities*, *Custom Entites* are:

* available across all users of an app
* access is controlled via ACL
* have an `entityType` for organization
* can have `owners` or be un-owned (as system objects)
* can be automatically deleted via TTL (time-to-live)

*Custom Entities* differ in these ways:

* You must pre-declare your `entityTypes` ahead-of-time
* You can create *custom indexes* for each `entityType` for fast lookups
* You can have an unlimited # of custom entities
* You can do partial updates of custom entities
* Custom entities support auto-migration during deployment

*Custom Entities* supports `text` index, `$text` operator can be use to query document fields once a `text` index is set up. Note that as the MongoDB restriction, one collection can have only one `text` index.
