![Online Multiplayer Process](<%= I18n.t(:root) %> <%= data.images.online_multiplayer_process %>)

*Lobbies* are used to gather up users prior to launching shared experiences via *Room Servers*. Users can be added to teams, indicate their ready status, and adjust personal and room settings before the experience starts.

The *Lobby Service* also offers highly configurable *Online Matchmaking* - to quickly and efficiently pair users up together.
