The **User Items** service, introduced in 4.2, is used to manage a collection of in-app items that users can be awarded, buy, sell, or trade (using virtual currency). Optionally, these items can be backed up to the blockchain.

Key concepts:

- Items are first defined in the **Item Catalog** 
- Defined items can be purchased or awarded to users, where they will be recorded as userItem instances.
- Using an item may consume it (or a portion of it - or none of it). Consumed items will automatically disappear from the user's user item inventory.
- Using an item may trigger a status effect (i.e. invulnerability for 60 seconds)
- Using an item may trigger a cool-down period (before the item can be used again) or a regeneration period (a period after which the item regenerates a "use.")
