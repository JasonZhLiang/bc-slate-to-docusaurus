### GetAuthenticationPacketTimeout

```csharp
int timeout = <%= data.branding.codePrefix %>.GetAuthenticationPacketTimeout();
```

```cpp
int timeout = <%= data.branding.codePrefix %>->getAuthenticationPacketTimeout();
```

```objective_c
int timeout = [<%= data.branding.codePrefix %> getAuthenticationPacketTimeout];
```

```java
int timeout = <%= data.branding.codePrefix %>.getAuthenticationPacketTimeout();
```

```javascript
// N/A
```

Gets the authentication packet timeout which is tracked separately from all other packets. Note that authentication packets are never retried and so this value represents the total time a client would wait to receive a reply to an authentication API call.

By default this timeout is set to 15 seconds.
